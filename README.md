LIVE: https://manufac-assignment-azure.vercel.app/

This project visualizes data from the Indian Agriculture dataset, made available by the National Data and Analytics Platform, NITI Aayog.

The project includes a table and a bar chart, implemented using Mantine and Apache ECharts, respectively. It is built using TypeScript and the Vite Min Template for Mantine.

## Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript**: Used for writing all the code, ensuring type safety and better maintainability.
- **Vite Min Template**: Utilized for its fast build times and modern development experience, with TypeScript already configured.
- **Mantine v7**: A React component library used for building the table component, providing a rich UI experience.
- **Apache ECharts**: Used for rendering the bar chart, offering a powerful and flexible charting library.
- **Yarn**: Preferred package manager for handling dependencies and running scripts.

## Features

1. **Table Component**: Aggregates crops data to display the crop with maximum and minimum production for each year. Built with Mantine v7.
2. **Bar Chart Component**: Visualizes the average yield of crops, with the crop name on the x-axis and average yield on the y-axis, using Apache ECharts.
